Hello world! 

Hey! 

Hey there! I'm Adrian, a web developer originally from Lugo, Galicia. After living in Leeds for 5 years, then spending 2 years in Ciutadella de Menorca (Balearic Islands) and another year in Santiago de Compostela, I've happily planted my roots in A Coru√±a. It's been quite the adventure, but I've found my perfect spot!

I create and design web applications using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Ionic, Angular, Symfony and Wordpress.
